Experience 
======
* **Physical origins and significance of adsorption heat**
  * Adsorption heat is a cornerstone concept underpinning almost all the existing theoretical isotherms for porous media. However, it remains elusive what this concept stands for and the physical sources for it. This work elucidated the physical origins of the adsorption heat with the aid of the law of mass action, facilitating the establishment of a two-parameter sorption isotherm equation theoretically converted to two widely used adsorption isotherm equations.

* **Hydrogen bonding Network of adsorptive water in variably saturated soil**
  * **Quality index development:** Pioneer the first quality measure for construction big data in EPB shield tunneling, which consists of three components, i.e., representativeness, diversity, and informativeness
  * **Verify the effectiveness of the proposed quality index:** The quality index of data is quantitatively compared with the performance of the models developed by data via a correlation analysis, the high R-values that more than 0.9 confirms the effectiveness of the quality index

*  **Data-driven modeling for ground loss in EPB shield tunneling**
    * **Evaluation of existing methods for ground loss:** Survey the existing formulations for ground loss, and quantitatively evaluate them based on the collected field dataset 
    * **Hybrid model for tunneling-induced settlement:** Develop a random forest model for capturing the relationship between the ground loss and related features, which is integrated into the classical settlement solutions, yielding a hybrid model for tunneling-induced settlement

* **Transfer learning for chamber pressure prediction in EPB shield tunneling**
  * **Transfer learning framework for chamber pressure prediction:** Introduced the transfer learning methods, e.g., fine-tuning, CORAL, and MMD, for enhancing the generalization ability of existing models in predicting chamber pressure from different projects
  * **Performance of the transfer learning frameworks:** Utilize two filed datasets from Tianjin City and Changsha City to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected transfer learning methods in the few-shots problem of chamber pressure prediction

* **Surrogate model for structural response under dynamical loading**
  * **Surrogate model development:** We are the first to introduce deep neural operators e.g., DeepONet and FNO, into surrogate modeling for the response of underground structures under dynamical loading
  * **Transfer learning of surrogate model:** We implemented transfer learning methods for maintaining the effectiveness of the developed models under different geological conditions
