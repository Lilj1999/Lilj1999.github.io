Experience 
======
* Physics-informed inverse modeling for SWRC and HC
  * Specify an inverse PINN for identifying SWRC and HCF: Encode the Richardson-Richards equation (RRE) into the loss function of a neural network, and set constitutive parameters of SWRC and HCF as trainable parameters 
  * Determine the boundary condition of the RRE: Survey the common experiments, identifying their boundary conditions and enforcing them in the loss function 
  * Validation: Simulated data and experiment data are utilized for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework 
* Quality index for construction big data in EPB shield tunneling
  * Quality index development: Pioneere the first quality measure for construction big data in EPB shield tunneling, which consists of three components, i.e., representativeness, diversity, and informativeness. 
  * Verify the effectiveness of the proposed quality index: The quality index of data and the performance of the models developed by data are quantitatively compared via a correlation analysis, the high R-values Â¿0.9 confirms the effectiveness of the quality index
