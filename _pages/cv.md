Experience 
======
* Physics-informed inverse modeling for SWRC and HC
  * Specify an inverse PINN for identifying SWRC and HCF: Encode the Richardson-Richards equation (RRE) into the loss function of a neural network, and set constitutive parameters of SWRC and HCF as trainable parameters 
  * Determine the boundary condition of the RRE: Survey the common experiments, identifying their boundary conditions and enforcing them in the loss function 
  * Validation: Simulated data and experiment data are utilized for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework 
* Quality index for construction big data in EPB shield tunneling
  * Quality index development: Pioneere the first quality measure for construction big data in EPB shield tunneling, which consists of three components, i.e., representativeness, diversity, and informativeness. 
  * Verify the effectiveness of the proposed quality index: The quality index of data and the performance of the models developed by data are quantitatively compared via a correlation analysis, the high R-values Â¿0.9 confirms the effectiveness of the quality index 
* Surrogate model for structures response under dynamical loading
  * Surrogate model development: We are the first to introduce deep neural operators e.g., DeepONet and FNO, into surrogate modeling for structure response under dynamical loading
  * Transfer learning of surrogate model: We implemented transfer learning methods for helping developed models maintain effectiveness under different conditions 
* Transfer learning for chamber pressure prediction in EPB shield tunneling
  * Transfer learning framework for chamber pressure prediction: Introduced the transfer learning methods, e.g., fine-tuning, CORAL, and MMD, for enhancing the generalization ability of existing models in predicting chamber pressure from different projects 
  * Performance of the transfer learning frameworks: Utilize two filed datasets from Tianjin City and Changsha City to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected transfer learning methods in the few-shots problem of chamber pressure prediction 

*  Data-driven modeling for ground loss in EPB shield tunneling
  * Evaluation of existing methods for ground loss: Survey the existing formulations for ground loss, and quantitatively evaluate them based on the collected field dataset 
  * Hybrid model for tunneling-induced settlement: Develop a random forest model for capturing the relationship between the ground loss and related features, which is integrated into the classical settlement solutions, yielding a hybrid model for tunneling-induced settlement 


* Calculation method for the illuminance in tunnels
  * Reflection properties of tunnel wall: Implement a so-called five-parameter model for identifying the reflection properties of tunnel walls, calibrating the models with the experimental results of common materials of tunnel walls
  *  Solution for the illuminance in tunnels: Taken reflection properties of tunnel walls into illuminance calculation via the five-parameter model and proposed an analytical solution.
