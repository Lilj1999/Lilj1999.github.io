title: "A novel tunnel lighting method aided by highly diffuse reflective materials on the sidewall: Theory and practice"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/3-paper
excerpt: 'We implement a so-called five-parameter model for identifying the reflection properties of tunnel walls, calibrating the models with the experimental results of common materials of tunnel walls. Then, We taken reflection properties of tunnel walls into illuminance calculation via the five-parameter model and proposed an analytical solution. '
